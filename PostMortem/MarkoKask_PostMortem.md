**PROJECT POST-MORTEM**

**Project Title:** More Asteroids

**Date:** 04/01/2024 – 31/01/2024

**Post-Mortem Author:** Marko Kask

**Project Overview:**

The aim of the project was to collaboratively develop something with a 5-6 member team up to the minimum viable product. These were main requirements and recommendations:

1. Use of Git: basic branching and merging;

2. Use of freely chosen team collaboration software;

3. Each team member writes a post-mortem about the project period;

4. It was recommended to use development technologies that have not been used before;

5. The main goal of the project is to gain experience working as a team, the project may also be incomplete or not working;

Our team consisted of 6 members: Kenneth Muuli (project manager), Alvin Kask, Marko Kask, Kaido Metsa, Liidia Ilves and Marko Villemson.

For team development management, we utilized GitHub with its own project management tool. Additionally, we established a communication group on Discord and Microsoft Teams to maintain daily contact with each other.

The project involved using a Unity game engine(version 2023.2.4f1) and Visual Studio Code to create 2D game "More Asteroids" as a minimal viable product.

**My contribution to the project:**

- Implementing player ship shooting functionality.
- Implementing the destruction of the player´s ship upon collision with an asteroid.
- Implementing the destruction of an asteroid in a collision with a bullet fired from a ship.
- Implementing the destruction of a bullet fired from a ship after being fired within a specified time.
- Implementing the destruction of a bullet fired from a ship upon collision with an asteroid.
- Player score bug fix.
- Reviewing other people`s code.
- Helping other team members.

**PROJECT PROS:**

- **Tasks according to capacity:** Tasks proposed by the project manager were distributed on the basis of voluntariness. Tasks were small enough that even a person with little knowledge of Unity could do them at least at the level that the code did what was needed.
- **A good project manager:** Project manager had a clear vision and a project plan for where and when the project should finally end up. Since the project manager himself has extensive experience with the Unity game engine, he was always able to guide and help the group members when questions or problems arose.
- **Good project management and teamwork:** Every week there was a project meeting where problems were discussed, parts of the project done by team members were shown and new tasks were distributed.
- **Collaborative relationships:** Team was able to maintain good collaborative relationships with each other by involving all group members from the beginning to the end of the process.
- **Good development support:** Since Unity is a common game engine, there are enough helpful materials on the internet to solve tasks, starting from Unity`s official documentation and ending with YouTube for example.

**PROJECT CONS:**

- **Limited development time:** Inititally we understood that we have several months to complete the project, but this was not the case. Time to complete the project was actually about four weeks, so less than originally estimated. Therefore, it was decided that the ultimate goal of the project would be a product with minimum functionality, that is, a game where the most basic elements of the game have been implemented.
- **Communication:** Since the group members had many other responsibilities besides the given project, it was often difficult to get help quickly, because it was not known when any of the members would be available on Discord/Teams outside of the meeting.
- **Half-baked project:** Many additional features originally planned for the game were not realized due to lack of time.
- **Too little knowledge of Unity game engine:** Realization of seemingly simple tasks took a lot of time because the knowledge of Unity was minimal.

**Post Project Tasks / Future Considerations:**

In the future, we aim to focus on the following areas of development in the game:

- Improving the game logic.
- Refining and developing UI design.
- Integrating and enhancing sound effects.
- Implementing more functionality, special features.
- Improving existing code.

**Lessons learned:**

- **Smaller goals:** If development time allotted for the project is uncertain, then smaller goals should be established.
- **Improved communication:** Somehow such a communication channel should be created between team members so that someone is constantly available, then the development process would be faster.

This post mortem is an important tool for further developments, helping to identify strengths, weaknesses and lessons learned for future projects.
