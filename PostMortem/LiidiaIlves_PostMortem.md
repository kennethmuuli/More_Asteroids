**PROJECT POST-MORTEM**

Liidia Ilves

**Project Title:** More Asteroids

**Date:** 04/01/2024 â€“ 31/01/2024

**Project Overview:**

The aim of the project was to collaboratively develop something with a 5-6 member team up to the minimum viable product. There were three main requirements:

1. Use of Git: basic branching and merging;

2. Use of freely chosen team collaboration software;

3. Each team member writes a post-mortem about the project period.

Our team consisted of 6 members: Kenneth Muuli (project manager), Alvin Kask, Marko Kask, Kaido Metsa, Liidia Ilves and Marko Villemson.

For team development management, we utilized GitHub with its own project management tool. Additionally, we established a communication group on Discord and Teams to maintain daily contact with each other.

The project involved using a 2D/3D engine and framework Unity (version 2023.2.4f1) and Visual Studio Code to create a 2D-game named "More Asteroids" as a minimal viable product.

**Key Accomplishments:**

- This project provided a valuable team collaboration experience.
- The formed team was highly cohesive, and teamwork flowed seamlessly. The project manager was an excellent initiator, and being the most experienced in game development, directed the course of game development and assisted all team members extensively and very professionally.
- The project idea was very strong, and everyone immediately grasped it without any disagreements in the concept.
- The use of Git became more familiar, and I learned some new useful commands and tricks. My ability to distribute development tasks into commits and the skill of writing commit messages improved.
- The Github management tool was very convenient and intuitively easy to use. I had previously dealt with Microsoft Azure, and the current one was quite similar, making it understandable and familiar to use.
- I am very pleased that the initially utopian goal of completing the MVP essentially succeeded, largely due to the project manager's experience.
- I learned a lot in this project: I had to quickly familiarize myself with the Unity game engine (with which I had no prior experience at all) and, for this purpose, I put effort into completing the Udemy video course "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D", which included 18.5 hours of on-demand videos. Within the scope of this course, I participated in creating five 2D games, and the time spent completing this course was certainly more than 40 hours...
- All the tasks assigned to me were interesting. My tasks in the project included UI and animations, and to implement them, I referred to various tutorials in YouTube videos, with several team members also being very helpful.
- At the outset, we agreed upon weekly meetings, which also served as conditional deadlines for the completion of our weekly tasks. This proved to be highly motivating, and the meetings were both substantive and invigorating, infusing new energy into our efforts.
- Becoming acquainted with Unity also contributed to a better understanding of the capabilities of the C# language, as everything was visually testable.
- Exploring the capabilities of Unity and delving into the overall concept of game creation provided a wealth of inspiration and encouragement to continue exploring the possibilities of game development in the future.

**Key Problem Areas:**

- As Unity was an entirely new development platform for me, grasping the concept and familiarizing myself with its capabilities took a considerable amount of time, making it challenging to provide immediate value to fellow team members.
- The completed Udemy course had a very well-structured format, was informative, and surprisingly aligned well with our project. However, going through 19 hours of dense, fast-paced video instruction and actively participating (which led me to revisit everything at least once with breaks) was very exhausting and, at times, created a sense of hopelessness due to the multitude of nuances to consider.
- The use of the project board could have been more purposeful.
- Since the Unity game engine was equally new to most team members and required learning from scratch, it appears that a disproportionately large responsibility and workload fell on the shoulders of the project manager.

**Post Project Tasks / Future Considerations:**

In the future, we aim to focus on the following areas of development in the game:

- Advancing the game logic.
- Refining and developing UI design.
- Integrating and enhancing sound effects.
