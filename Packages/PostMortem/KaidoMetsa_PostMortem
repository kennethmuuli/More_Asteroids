Project Post-Mortem: More Asteroids
Date: 04/01/2024 – 31/01/2024

Introduction:
The More Asteroids project, led by Kenneth,inspired by the a classic game of asteroids, providing an opportunity for the team to learn GitHub collaboration and work collectively on game development. The team included Kenneth, Kaido, Marko, Marko V, Liidia, and Alvin.
The project involved using a 2D/3D engine and framework Unity (version 2023.2.4f1) and Visual Studio Code to create a 2D-game named "More Asteroids" as a minimal viable product.

Project Overview:
Objective: Create a classic game of asteroids named More Asteroids.
Scope: The project aimed to serve as a learning experience for GitHub collaboration and Unity game development.

o	Requestid and reviews
o	Merging

What Went Well:

Team Collaboration:
The team demonstrated high cohesion, with the project manager providing excellent leadership.
The project idea was well-received, and everyone quickly grasped the concept.

Regular team meetings were held, fostering effective communication and collaboration.
Everyone had the opportunity to review each other's work and progress. Everyone was tuned in to the project and mostly everything from the to do list got done by due date.
Learning Curve:

The project served as a valuable learning experience for team members unfamiliar with Unity.
Also a great way focuse on using git bash and github itself.
Weekly meetings helped to address challenges and provide mutual support.
Individual Contributions:

•	Kaido focused on asteroid mechanics and borders.
•	Liidia worked on the UI.
•	Alvin concentrated on power-ups and backgrounds.
•	Marko V contributed to bullets and shooting effects.
•	Marko handled ship movement mechanics.
•	Kenneth provided leadership and guidance.


Challenges and Obstacles:
Scoring System Issue:
The scoring tracker presented challenges, giving an unexpectedly high score for destroying asteroids.
Resolving this issue became a focus towards the end of the project.
Basically everything was a challange in this game because 5 out of 6 never had done anything like this project. I would say also merging the branches and changes so it wont break the game project itself was a challange.

Lessons Learned:

GitHub Collaboration:
Team members gained proficiency in using GitHub for collaboration and version control.
Weekly meetings facilitated efficient project management and communication.

Unity Learning Curve:
The project served as an effective introduction to Unity for most team members.
Overcoming Unity-related challenges contributed to valuable skill development.

Recommendations for Improvement:
Scoring System Refinement:
Further testing and refinement of the scoring system to ensure accurate and balanced scoring.
Future Planning:
•	Adding power ups
•	Adding a second player/multiplayer
•	Adding lives 
•	Adding difficulty levels
•	Adding bosses
•	Android support

Consider extending the project timeline by an additional month to continue skill development and address any remaining issues.

Conclusion:
The More Asteroids project provided a platform for collaborative learning and skill development. Despite facing challenges we met, the team successfully navigated the Unity learning curve and the systems of github. Looking forward, the project has the potential for further improvement, and the team is considering an extended timeline to refine and enhance the game.
